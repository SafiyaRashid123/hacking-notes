SNMPBULKWALK IF MCUH FASTER SO USE THAT , search for /bin/bash then 
SNMP -UDP PORT TO BE SCANNED FOR  WITH -sU flag 
############ snmp -c public -v 2c <IP> ############# public a read only acces string ( private string allowed changes also )
############ snmpbulkwalk -Cr1000 -c public -v2c ip . (add the datat for futher sorting into a file > filename) ########### .: STARTS GETTING THE TRAFFIC FORM THE TOP -C: TOO SPECIFY COMMAND LINE TOOL r1000 : 1000 packets in a min.
bulkwalk gets a lot of requests in a go.

THINGS TO KNOW :
___________________
1) snmp
This is the generic command. It's usually followed by a specific action like:

snmpget to retrieve a single value.
snmpwalk to retrieve a whole tree of values.
snmptable to get a table.
snmpbulkget for efficient bulk requests.


A TOOL 
downloading steps :
sudo apt install snmp-mibs-downloader
sudo nano /etc/snmp/snmp.conf  , comment out mibs

snmpwalk gives a lot of information, steps to sort out the info 

We are given a command: grep -oP '::.*?\.' filename | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
Let's break it down step by step:

---################

-o: Print only the matched parts of a matching line.
-P: Use Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE).
The pattern '::.*?\.':
::: Matches the literal string "::".
.*?: Matches any character (except newline) in a non-greedy way (as few as possible).
\.: Matches a literal dot (period).
So, this will match any substring that starts with "::" and ends with the first following dot (period). sort: Sorts the matched strings alphabetically. uniq -c: Counts the number of occurrences of each unique string sort -n: Sorts the counts numerically (by the count value).

::hrSWRunName., ::hrSWRunPath.: (Not on your list but often available) List of running software/processes and their paths. An attacker can see what security software (AV, EDR, HIDS) is running to figure out how to evade it.
